Steganography in floating point data with NaN payloads

- **Github repository**: <https://github.com/kjordahl/steganan/>

Do you have not-a-number values in your floating point data that
you're not making full use of?  Have you ever pondered what to do with
all of those wasted bits? Steganan may be for you!  Encode whatever
data you like into those spare bits! Most programs won't even notice
the difference. Save them out to a file if you like. As long as your
file format preserves the full floating point values, you can get your
hidden data back!

Want to add compression and/or encryption of your data? That is
certainly possible, but is left as an exercise for the user.
